# 100-days-of-Coding
I am based in Nairobi, Kenya, and I love IT. 
I have been planning to start my coding Journey for quite a long time
I have finally decided to take that bold step. 
and as I am speaking I am working on my MA project on Human Rights and struggling with Nvivo
I am also working on my research project for my Diploma in Clinical Psychology
I also want to venture into the world of Blockchains and bitcoins
My work is also demanding, I am required to develop two training manuals on Open Governance and Public Education on Health!
let us see where this will take me!
