# 100-days-of-Coding
I am based in Nairobi, Kenya, and i love IT. 
I have been planning to start my coding Journey for quiet a long time
I have finally decided to take that bold step. 
and as I am speaking I am working on my MA project on Human rights and struggling with Nvivo
I am also workin on my research project for my Diploma in Clinical Psychology
I also want to venture into the world of Block chains and bitcoins
My work is also demanding, i am required to develop two training manuals on Open Governance and Public Education on Health!
lets see where this will take me!
